// From raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf:
// Critical Section API for short-lived mutual exclusion safe for IRQ and multi-core.
// A critical section is non-reentrant, and provides mutual exclusion using a spin-lock to prevent
// access from the other core, and from (higher priority) interrupts on the same core. It does the
// former using a spin lock and the latter by disabling interrupts on the calling core. Because
// interrupts are disabled when a critical_section is owned, uses of the critical_section should be
// as short as possible.
