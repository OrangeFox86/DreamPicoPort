//! This class is similar to std::lock_guard, but it is specifically meant to be used with
//! MutexInterface. The special thing with MutexInterface is that doing a blocking lock has the
//! potential to cause a deadlock (because spin lock is used, and there is no way to yield from IRQ
//! context). As such, the functionality using the mutex must check this and perform necessary
//! operations (even if it's just to log an error and spin forever).
